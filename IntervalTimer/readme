user stories
-user should go to the website and see timer option input
-user enters number of intervals, the time of the intervals, and can click go from there
-user has the option to add a break, which will reveal input for time of break
-there is a plus button where user can add another timer option input module, which has the same count, time, and break options
-user can add up to 10 modules (arbitrary. see if that feels like the right number when sober)
-user can move finished modules up and down in the sequence
-once user clicks "go", the timer will start
    -at the end of each primary session, an alarm will sound. a different alarm at the end of each break
    -breaks occur after each primary session except the last, unless there is a new module after it.
        -for example:
            -user selects 4 ints, 25 minute primary 5 minute break:
                -prime, break, prime, break, prime, break, prime. end. (4p 3b)
            -user selects above, + 3 int, 10 minute primary, no break
                -prime1, break1, prime1, break1, prime1, break1, prime1, break1, prime2, prime2, prime2. end. (4p 4b of first module)
-clock will visibly tick down on screen

To-do:
-make inputs re-orderable through drag and drop
-implement caching so that user does not need to reenter timers when they come back
-find and add alarm tones: interval over, break over, 3-second countdown, all intervals complete.
-remove timer and display rounds data and congratulations message
-make responsive
-make pretty with css (maybe fun animation as time ticks down)
-modal pretty https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp
-end interval early option (terminates countdown and advances to next round)

Completed:
-create initial empty DOM, with containers for input and timer display
-create JS functions to insert input fields into DOM
-add + button to add more interval inputs
-add - button to remove its parent interval input
-add input validation/guardrails
-pull data from input fields
-hide input fields once timer is started
-reveal timer holder when timer is started
-create pause button stop timer and keep state 
-create stop button to stop timer, delete state, make inputs visible again
-add popup/timer block if user has entered no intervals
-reset button to clear all fields and remove all but first interval
